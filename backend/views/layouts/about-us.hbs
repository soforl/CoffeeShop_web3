        One day the owner of CO&GO was so depressed and did not want to go out of her bed,
        but the smell of the coffee from the nearest coffee shop made her get up.
        She went out of her flat, took coffee and saw pictures that made her really happy.
        She noticed leaves that had fallen to streets and people enjoying their life, and
        she understood that this world is so beautiful with a cup of the greatest drink.
      </p>

      <p>
        The other day the owner started to build her coffee business and chose the best
        types of beans and barista.

        So we hope that our coffee will help you in the darkest times and will be part of the brightest ones!

      We wanted to know which type of coffee people prefer to drink most of all,
      so there are results of our investigation!
